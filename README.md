## Overview
This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the Lead Capture App.

---
## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Lead Entry Now Saved to Supabase Database
**File**: [`src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`](src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx), [`supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`](supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts)

**Severity**: High

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem
Leads submitted via the form were not being stored in the Supabase `leads` table, resulting in lost data and no backend record of submissions.

#### Root Cause
There was no code to insert lead data into the leads table in Supabase.

#### Fix
Added code to insert lead data into the leads table in Supabase. This ensures leads are persisted in the database on form submission

#### Impact
- ✅ All leads are now reliably stored in the database.

---

### 2. Session Lead Count Now Accurate and Persistent
**File**: [`src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`](src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx)

**Severity**: Medium

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem
The UI showed "You're #1 in this session" after every page refresh, because the count was only tracked in local state.

#### Root Cause
The session lead count was not not stored in the database, so it reset on reload.

#### Fix
- The frontend now stores session id and fetches the count of leads for the current session from Supabase on load and after each submission.
- The UI displays the correct session lead number, even after a refresh.

#### Impact
- ✅ Users see their true session lead number, not just a local count.

---

### 3. Removed Duplicate Confirmation Email API Call
**File**: [`src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`](src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx)

**Severity**: Low

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### Problem
The confirmation email Edge Function was being called twice for each lead submission, causing redundant emails and unnecessary API usage.

#### Root Cause
There were two separate invocations of the send-confirmation function in the form submission handler.

#### Fix
- Removed the duplicate API call so the confirmation email is only sent once per lead.

#### Impact
- ✅ No more duplicate confirmation emails.
- ✅ Reduced API usage and improved user experience.

### 4. Logical changes to improve the accuracy
The new logic ensures that:

The OpenAI API response is accessed at choices[0] (not choices[1]), preventing undefined errors.
The personalized content is always a string and is now actually included in the email body.
If the OpenAI API fails or returns no content, a fallback message is used.
